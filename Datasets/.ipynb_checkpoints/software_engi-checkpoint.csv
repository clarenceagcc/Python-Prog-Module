Overmind is a platform where web3 developers learn how to build world-class dApps and compete on coding challenges to earn prizes and on-chain credentials. Our mission is to enable more developers to enter web3, build ground-breaking products, and access rare opportunities.

We believe that one of the biggest drags on crypto’s growth is the friction and uncertainty that developers face in the transition from web2 to web3. We are introducing “solve-to-earn” to de-risk the time and energy investment required to learn and practice web3 development, thereby offering a real opportunity to enter the space to significantly more people. Solving challenges on Overmind creates a transparent, verifiable track record of one’s skill and creativity, forming the first on-chain resume we have seen that contains real signal. We strongly believe that on-chain reputation will be one of the foundational layers of the crypto economy, and that the resume is where it all starts.

The Overmind is formed by the collective intelligence of those bold enough to join it. Enter at overmind.xyz.

Core Software Developer - Singapore
Summary

This is a superb opportunity for a proactive and pragmatic engineer to join an award-winning, tech-savvy algorithmic trading firm in Singapore.

Core Development is responsible for the design, implementation and operation of the multi-faceted technology platform, supporting all aspects of the firm's post-trade activities. You'll maintain highly available real-time systems and a host of tools, jobs, services and GUIs, operating effectively in a highly automated way.

This role offers the satisfaction of being involved in the entire lifecycle of software development, and the broad range of functions supported means you'll collaborate with almost every department in the firm: understanding users' needs and translating them into solutions that you design, implement and support.
